# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:This is the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Software engineering is more intelligent and usesa mosre structured and developed process

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile addresses risks continuously through the process while waterfall attempts to mitigate risks in the initial stages of the project.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:Agile is more relaxed and iterative while waterfall is more rigid with phases completed in order. Agile allows for flexibility and collaboration and the focus is on small incremental releases. Waterfall is sequential and each phase has to be completed to move to the next

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: This is the process of eliciting stakeholder needs and desires and developing them into the agreed upon set of detailed requirements. It starts by becoming farmiliar with the important details and requirements, carrying out requirements specification, verification and validation and finally managing the requirements into the agreed output.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:Modularity advocates for creating software independent of dependency among the components of the system. This helps to ensure impact if changes is localized and maintennace is simplied and the system is easy to understand.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems: Unit testing is the basic test done by the developer before handing the software to the testing team. Integrated testing is done by the testing team and is done using integration testing tools. System testing is done to identify bugs and challenges and ensuring specifications are being met. Acceptance testing that determines whether or not the software should be released to the public. Testing is important in software development because it helps locate defective areas while preventing errors in development life cycle stages.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:These are systems that help software developers and teams to manage changes to source code over time. They are important in tracking and managing changes to software code. Git is a popular example of version control system.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: Software project manager analyses project constraints, establishes the objectives of the project, coordinate with internal and external stakeholders, determine timelines and monitor the KPIs

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: This is the process of modifying, updating, changing the software to keep up with the needs and desires of the customers. The different types of maintenance include faulty repairs, environmental adaptation and functionality addition. Maintenance is important since it improves the software and correct bugs and isues which in turn boosts performance.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? peivacy and accuracy
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
